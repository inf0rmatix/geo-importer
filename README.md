# GeoNames Importer

**Work in Progress:** This project is actively being developed, and contributions are highly encouraged! If you're interested in using or improving it, your input is more than welcome.

GeoNames Importer aims to build a powerful, containerized database solution based on the rich [GeoNames](https://www.geonames.org/) dataset. The primary goal is to make it easy to fetch and work with geographic entities such as regions, countries, and citiesâ€”especially those relevant for vacation destination searches. By focusing on places that matter most to travelers and vacation planners, this project seeks to provide a solid foundation for travel, tourism, and location-based applications.

Currently, the workflow automates the download, filtering, and import of GeoNames data into a PostgreSQL database, with an emphasis on German-language and administrative geodata. The architecture is designed for reproducibility, ARM compatibility, and script-driven extensibility, making it suitable for a wide range of environments and future enhancements.

## Features

- **Automated download** of GeoNames datasets (`allCountries.zip`, `alternateNamesV2.zip`)
- **Filtering** for relevant languages (default: German) and feature codes (administrative, populated places, etc.)
- **Data import** into a PostgreSQL database with a custom schema
- **Fully containerized** using Docker and Docker Compose

## Project Structure

- `Dockerfile`: Builds an ARM-compatible image with PostgreSQL and required tools.
- `docker-compose.yml`: Defines two services:
  - `db`: PostgreSQL 15 database with persistent storage.
  - `importer`: Runs the import scripts and loads data into the database.
- `scripts/`: Contains all shell scripts for downloading, filtering, and importing data.
- `sql/`: SQL files for schema initialization and data import.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) installed.

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**  

   ```sh
   git clone <this-repo-url>
   cd geo-importer
   ```

2. **Start the database and run the importer**  

   ```sh
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

   This will:
   - Start a PostgreSQL database (`db` service)
   - Build and run the importer container, which will:
     - Download and extract the GeoNames data
     - Filter the data for relevant entries
     - Initialize the database schema
     - Import the filtered data

3. **Access the database**  
   The database will be available on `localhost:5432` with:
   - Database: `geonames`
   - User: `geo`
   - Password: `geo_pass`

   You can connect using any PostgreSQL client:

   ```sh
   psql -h localhost -U geo -d geonames
   ```

## Script Overview

- `scripts/download_and_extract.sh`: Downloads and unzips the required GeoNames datasets.
- `scripts/filter_data.sh`: Filters the raw data for German language and specific feature codes, preparing it for import.
- `scripts/init_schema.sh`: Initializes the database schema using the provided SQL.
- `scripts/import_data.sh`: Loads the filtered data into the database and populates the main tables.

## Customization

- You can adjust filtering by setting environment variables in `docker-compose.yml` (e.g., `GEONAMES_LANG`, `GEONAMES_FEATURE_CLASS`, `GEONAMES_FEATURE_CODES`).
- SQL schema and import logic can be modified in the `sql/` directory.

## Data Volumes

- `pgdata`: Persists PostgreSQL data between runs.
- `temp`: Used for temporary storage of downloaded and processed files.
